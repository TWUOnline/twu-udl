## Session Objectives

As a result of this presentation, participants will be able to: 
- Define UDL  
- Describe the characteristics of UDL  
- Explain the research supporting the implementation of UDL  
- Consider the UDL framework when planning & implementing instruction  

## What is UDL?

Since 1984, [CAST](https://www.cast.org/) has sought to explore how to help learners across ages and settings to achieve high standards. 

UDL was founded on that effort.

Continued growth: Rising to Equity Initiative

#### Applied Research {-}
CAST investigates solutions to the most critical questions across preK-12, higher ed, and workforce, including questions related to equity, access, and outcomes.

#### Design and Development {-}
Building on an award winning history, CAST co-designs transformative solutions, improvement strategies, and tools for learning.

#### Building Knowledge, Skills, and Community {-}
CAST offers professional learning convenings, technical assistance, practical resources, and online platforms that support UDL implementation.

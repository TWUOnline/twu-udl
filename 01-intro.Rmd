Presenters:   
- Moira Fricke, M.A., Trinity Western University  
- Ruby L. Owiny, Ph.D., Trinity International University   

## Poll 

1. How much do you know about UDL?
    - A little
    - A lot
    - None
2. How much have you incorporated UDL principles into the design of your courses?
    - A little
    - A lot
    - None
3. Do you agree or disagree with the following quote?  

> “A mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled.  If a child (student) can’t learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they can learn”. ~ Ignacio ‘Nacho’ Estrada

## Why should we care about UDL?

#### Breakthrough Room Questions
1. What concerns do you have for your students?  
2. What challenges do your students face (e.g., disability, single-parents, working a lot, etc.)? 

```

## Session Objectives

As a result of this presentation, participants will be able to: 
- Define UDL  
- Describe the characteristics of UDL  
- Explain the research supporting the implementation of UDL  
- Consider the UDL framework when planning & implementing instruction  

## What is UDL?

Since 1984, [CAST](https://www.cast.org/) has sought to explore how to help learners across ages and settings to achieve high standards. 

UDL was founded on that effort.

Continued growth: Rising to Equity Initiative  

![CAST Overview](assets/cast.png "One page overview of CAST. There is a Venn diagram of three overlapping circles. The top circle reads 'Design and Development'. The bottom left circle reads 'Applied research'. The bottom right circle reads 'Professional learning'. The intersection where all three circles overlap reads 'UDL'. Text follows on the page.")

### Learn with us. Research with us. Change the world with us.{-} 
> Universal Design for Learning is ont of the few big and truly transformative ideas to emerge in education over the past two decades. ~Martha L. Minow, Former Harvard Law School dean and author of *Just Schools: Pursuing Equality in Societies of Difference

Partners include:
- PreK-12 stakeholders  
- Higher education  
- workforce  
- Tech and publishing industries  
- Government agencies  
- Nonprofits   
- Foundations and donors  
- Advocacy Organizations  

#### Our Core Lever of Change {-}
We pioneered Universal Design for Learning (UDL), a research-based framework that guides educator and others as they provide rich instructional supports, reduce unnecessary barriers to learning, and help all individuals become expert learners.

#### Applied Research {-}
CAST investigates solutions to the most critical questions across preK-12, higher ed, and workforce, including questions related to equity, access, and outcomes.

#### Design and Development {-}
Building on an award winning history, CAST co-designs transformative solutions, improvement strategies, and tools for learning.

#### Building Knowledge, Skills, and Community {-}
CAST offers professional learning convenings, technical assistance, practical resources, and online platforms that support UDL implementation.

## Paradigm Shift

UDL is a shift in how we ***think*** about students, curriculum and instruction. Instead of attempting to fix the ***student***, we fix ***curriculum and instruction.***

> Consider the needs of the broadest possible range of users from the beginning. ~Architect, Ron Mace

Consider the following images:

![Ramp built onto the side of a building](assets/add-on.png "The image shows a complicated ramp that has been built onto the side of a building")![Ramp designed into a building](assets/spiral.png "The image shows a spiral accessibility ramp designed as part of a building from the beginning.")

## A Path for Everyone

![Cartoon Panel](assets/ramp-comic.png "A comic that shows a snowy staircase and a ramp beside them, also covered with snow. There are several children at the bottom of the ramp/stairs. One child, who is in a wheelchair, asks a man with a shovel "Could you please shovel the ramp?". The man answers "All these other children are waiting to use the stairs. When I get through shoveling them off, then I will clear the ramp for you." The child in the wheelchair responds "But if you shovel the ramp, we can all get in!" The caption reads "Clearing a path for people with special needs clears the path for everyone!"")

## Adjustable car seats

Do you use the features in your car to adjust the height, angle, and distance from the steering wheel?

What if you couldn't do that? How comfortable would you be driving? how safe would you be?

## Where did UDL come from?

### Learner Variability

![fMRI Brain Activity Patterns](assets/fmri.png)

- Three different fMRI brain activity patterns showing different people performing the same finger-tapping task.
- Colour represents levels of brain activity during performance
    - Blue = low to moderate activity
    - Red = high activity
    - Yellow = extremely high activity

### Brain Networks

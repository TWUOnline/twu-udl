Owiny, Ph.D., Trinity International University 1.1 Poll How much do you know about UDL? A little A lot None How much have you incorporated UDL principles into the design of your courses? A little A lot None Do you agree or disagree with the following quote? “A mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled. If a child (student) can’t learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they can learn”. ~ Ignacio ‘Nacho’ Estrada 1.2 Why should we care about UDL? 1.3 TWU Context Age of Undergrad Students Number Under 18 86 18-24 2023 25+ 337 Percentage of Indigenous Students Percent Undergrad &lt;1% Graduate &lt;1% Percentage of International Students Percent Undergrad 45% Graduate 75% Breakthrough Room Questions What concerns do you have for your students? What challenges do your students face (e.g., disability, single-parents, working a lot, etc.)? 1.4 Session Objectives As a result of this presentation, participants will be able to: - Define UDL - Describe the characteristics of UDL - Explain the research supporting the implementation of UDL - Consider the UDL framework when planning &amp; implementing instruction 1.5 What is UDL? Since 1984, CAST has sought to explore how to help learners across ages and settings to achieve high standards. UDL was founded on that effort. Continued growth: Rising to Equity Initiative CAST Overview Image Contents Learn with us. Research with us. Change the world with us. Universal Design for Learning is ont of the few big and truly transformative ideas to emerge in education over the past two decades. ~Martha L. Minow, Former Harvard Law School dean and author of *Just Schools: Pursuing Equality in Societies of Difference Partners include: - PreK-12 stakeholders - Higher education - workforce - Tech and publishing industries - Government agencies - Nonprofits - Foundations and donors - Advocacy Organizations Our Core Lever of Change We pioneered Universal Design for Learning (UDL), a research-based framework that guides educator and others as they provide rich instructional supports, reduce unnecessary barriers to learning, and help all individuals become expert learners. Applied Research CAST investigates solutions to the most critical questions across preK-12, higher ed, and workforce, including questions related to equity, access, and outcomes. Design and Development Building on an award winning history, CAST co-designs transformative solutions, improvement strategies, and tools for learning. Building Knowledge, Skills, and Community CAST offers professional learning convenings, technical assistance, practical resources, and online platforms that support UDL implementation.

Instead of attempting to fix the student, we fix curriculum and instruction. Consider the needs of the broadest possible range of users from the beginning. ~Architect, Ron Mace Consider the following images: 1.7 A Path for Everyone Cartoon Panel Photo Credit: Michael F. Giangreco and Kevin Ruelle. 1.8 Adjustable car seats Do you use the features in your car to adjust the height, angle, and distance from the steering wheel? What if you couldn’t do that? How comfortable would you be driving? how safe would you be? 1.9 Universal Design for Learning in Higher education 1.10 Where did UDL come from? 1.10.1 Learner Variability fMRI Brain Activity Patterns Three different fMRI brain activity patterns showing different people performing the same finger-tapping task. Colour represents levels of brain activity during performance Blue = low to moderate activity Red = high activity Yellow = extremely high activity 1.10.2 Brain Networks two types of brain research form the basis learner variability - no two people learn in exactly the same way brain networks - three different networks in our brains, each of which need to be engaged for high-quality learning The UDL framework provides instructors with tools to make sure all three networks are engaged with all learners. 1.10.3 UDL Premise To provide equitable opportunities to reach high standards across a variety of students. Jagged profile of learner characteristics 1.10.4 Three Brain Networks Image Source "],["unpacking-the-principles-discovering-the-joy.html", "Session 2 Unpacking the Principles, Discovering the Joy Designing Cars Universal Great Design Renovations Moira’s Experience", " Session 2 Unpacking the Principles, Discovering the Joy Presenters: David Stinson, M.A., Trinity Western University Moira Fricke, M.A., Trinity Western University Designing Cars What do you want to use it for? VW Bus for retro vibes Toyota Corolla for economical family transportation Ferrari for ostentatious displays of wealth Motorcycle for long rides on summer days and picking bugs out of your teeth Tesla for the environment Pick-up truck for hauling tools and toys Universal Great Design Great design involves prioritizing goals and making good choices that lead toward those goals. In the context of learning, that means prioritizing your learning objectives (what learners will know or be able to do after the successful completion of the course or learning activity), and making specific design choices that will allow you to not only get ‘there’, but also to know when your learners have arrived. The goal of UDL is to design learning experiences for many users with diverse abilities. Renovations If you have ever renovated a house, you know that there are some steps you go through in the process. Trigger Design Well Plan Figure out the logistics Cost/Reward Be realistic Great Design is rarely seen. Bad design is experienced on a regular basis. Moira’s Experience As a new TWU instructor, I will share my humble attempts to incorporate some UDL principles into my 3rd and 4th year Education courses. My sincere hope is this may inspire you to look at your own courses and see where they can bloom. The Four Curricular Pillars of UDL The Four Pillars of UDL Brain Networks Brain Networks UDL Learning Guidelines UDL Learning Guidelines Mea culpa We do realize that the images above are not accessible. It is not good to include a large amount of text in an image because screen-readers will not be able to render it. Additionally, the text on these screenshots is far too small. Why Care? Affective dimensions of learning… Recruit student interest Grab their attention Generate excitement Provide motivation What do I know? Present information, ideas, and content in different ways to maximize understanding: - Video - Audio - Graphics - Tactile objects - Accessible online text How students can ‘Show what they know’? Provide multiple ways that students can demonstrate their knowledge. Give students voice and choice. - Visual arts - Podcasts - Debates - Multi-media - Comics - Oral presentations Want to know more?
